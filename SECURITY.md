# üîí Security Policy

## Overview

The Fit Pathway Organizer project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and what to expect during the disclosure process.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

We implement multiple layers of security:

### Automated Security Scanning
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Automated code scanning runs on every PR and weekly
- **Dependency Scanning**: Dependabot monitors for vulnerable dependencies
- **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of exposed credentials

### Code Review Process
- All changes require pull request review
- Security-sensitive changes require additional scrutiny
- Automated checks must pass before merge

### Access Controls
- Principle of least privilege for all integrations
- Environment-based configuration (no hardcoded secrets)
- Secure API key management via environment variables

## üìã Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Support |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 0.0.x (latest) | ‚úÖ Yes       | Active Development |
| Older versions | ‚ùå No        | Upgrade Required |

**Note:** As this project is in active development (v0.0.0), we recommend always using the latest commit from the main branch.

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### Where to Report

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues via one of these channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory** (Recommended)
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/zoz-11/fit-pathway-organizer/security/advisories
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form

2. **Private Email**
   - Contact the maintainers directly
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Check GitHub profile for contact information

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

```markdown
**Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Authentication Bypass)

**Affected Component**: (e.g., Login form, API endpoint)

**Attack Scenario**: 
Describe how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability

**Proof of Concept**:
Step-by-step instructions to reproduce (or code samples)

**Impact Assessment**:
What data/functionality is at risk?

**Suggested Fix** (optional):
If you have ideas on how to fix it

**Environment**:
- Browser version (if applicable)
- Operating system
- Node.js version
```

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

| Stage | Timeline | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Initial Response** | 24-48 hours | Acknowledgment of report |
| **Triage** | 3-5 days | Severity assessment and validation |
| **Fix Development** | 1-2 weeks | Depends on complexity |
| **Public Disclosure** | 30 days | After fix is deployed |

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

#### üî¥ Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Complete data breach
- **Response Time**: Immediate (within 24 hours)

#### üü† High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Privilege escalation
- SQL injection
- Sensitive data exposure
- **Response Time**: Within 3 days

#### üü° Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- XSS vulnerabilities
- CSRF issues
- Information disclosure
- **Response Time**: Within 7 days

#### üü¢ Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- Best practice violations
- **Response Time**: Within 14 days

## üéØ What to Expect

### If Your Report is Accepted

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt and thank you
2. **Collaboration**: We may ask for additional information
3. **Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Notification**: We'll inform you when the fix is ready
5. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure
6. **Credit**: We'll credit you in release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)

### If Your Report is Declined

1. **Explanation**: We'll explain why it's not considered a vulnerability
2. **Alternative**: We may suggest filing a regular bug report
3. **Documentation**: We'll update docs if it's a misunderstanding

## üèÜ Security Hall of Fame

## üîê Security Best Practices for Contributors

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**
   ```bash
   # Use environment variables
   const apiKey = process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
   
   # Not this
   const apiKey = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."; // ‚ùå
   ```

2. **Validate all inputs**
   ```typescript
   // Use validation libraries
   import { z } from 'zod';
   
   const userSchema = z.object({
     email: z.string().email(),
     age: z.number().min(0).max(120)
   });
   ```

3. **Sanitize outputs**
   ```typescript
   // React automatically escapes in JSX
   <div>{userInput}</div> // ‚úÖ Safe
   
   // Be careful with dangerouslySetInnerHTML
   <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userInput}} /> // ‚ö†Ô∏è Only with sanitized input
   ```

4. **Use secure dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Regularly update dependencies
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   
   # Check for known vulnerabilities
   npm outdated
   ```

5. **Follow authentication best practices**
   - Use Supabase Auth for authentication
   - Never roll your own crypto
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls

### For Users

1. **Keep your installation updated**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   ```

2. **Use strong credentials**
   - Use unique passwords
   - Enable 2FA when available
   - Don't share API keys

3. **Report suspicious activity**
   - Unusual access patterns
   - Unexpected emails
   - Strange behavior
