- Instantly searches, cross-references, and answers technical or fitness-related queries using the latest official docs

### 2. Smart Code Orchestration
- Uses LangGraph-based workflows to intelligently break down complex coding tasks
- Auto-parallelizes independent subtasks for maximum efficiency
- Delegates and merges coding tasks with intelligent dependency management
- Optimizes execution paths for multi-step development workflows

### 3. A2A Protocol Communication Layer
- Implements agent-to-agent collaboration using the A2A protocol
- Coordinates with other agents to solve multi-step problems
- Shares status updates and learns new topics collaboratively
- Enables chain-of-thought reasoning across multiple agent systems

### 4. Self-Learning via Repo Monitoring
- Periodically scans and ingests updates from active GitHub projects
- Monitors repositories like wger, Lovablelabs/docs for new patterns
- Automatically improves skillset by detecting new best practices
- Stays current with evolving frameworks and methodologies

### 5. Integrated Fitness Planner
- Seamlessly integrates with open-source fitness app APIs (wger)
- Provides personalized workout routines based on user goals
- Nutrition logging and tracking capabilities
- Progress tracking and analytics
- All fitness data coded and managed directly by the agent

### 6. User Persona Adaptation
- Builds comprehensive user profiles from interactions
- Learns coding style preferences and framework choices
- Adapts to fitness goals and workout preferences
- Dynamically tailors recommendations, documentation, and workflow strategies
- Remembers context across sessions for continuous improvement

### 7. Documentation Mode Switching
- Reproduces Lovable's "Documentation Modes" for flexible output styles:
  - **Concise Mode**: Quick reference guides and summaries
  - **Deep Dive Mode**: Comprehensive technical explanations
  - **Tutorial Mode**: Step-by-step walkthroughs
  - **Action Planner Mode**: Task-oriented checklists and workflows
- Switches modes based on context or explicit user command

### 8. Instant VS Code Agent Launch
- Automates VS Code session startup for any coding task
- Pre-loads relevant documentation and project context
- Configures GitHub Copilot agent automatically
- Sets up workspace with appropriate extensions and settings
- Initializes development environment with one command

### 9. Best Practices Assistant
- References Firecrawl and Lovable.dev best practices internally
- Proactively suggests architectural improvements
- Recommends refactoring opportunities in real time
- Proposes testing strategies and quality assurance methods
- Ensures code follows industry standards and patterns

### 10. Agent Chain Debugger
- Visual workflow debugger for agentic tasks
- Shows step-wise progress through complex operations
- Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Allows user intervention at any step
- Supports "rewind/replay" functionality for complex problem-solving
- Provides transparency into agent decision-making process

## How to Use

### Getting Started

1. **Query with Coding or Fitness Challenges**
   - Ask any coding question, and the agent will find documentation, write code, and monitor relevant repos
   - Request fitness plans, and the agent will generate personalized routines via open-source APIs

2. **Specify Documentation Style**
   - Use commands like "concise mode" or "tutorial mode" to tailor explanations
   - Agent automatically adapts to your preferred learning style over time

3. **Collaborative Workflows**
   - Request multi-agent collaboration for tasks requiring multiple specialties
   - Agent coordinates with other agents via A2A protocol for complex problem-solving

4. **Fitness Management**
   - Generate and manage personalized fitness plans directly
   - Track workouts, nutrition, and progress automatically
   - Integrate with wearables and fitness apps

5. **Continuous Learning**
   - Agent automatically monitors and updates its knowledge base
   - Stays ahead of the tech curve with latest best practices
   - Learns from your coding patterns and preferences

### Example Commands

```
# Coding Tasks
"Set up a React project with TypeScript and best practices"
"Debug this function and explain the issue in tutorial mode"
"Find the latest Lovable.dev patterns for authentication"

# Fitness Tasks
"Create a 4-week strength training program for beginners"
"Log today's meals and calculate macros"
"Show my workout progress over the last month"

# Multi-Agent Collaboration
"Coordinate with design agent to build a fitness tracking UI"
"Work with data agent to analyze my coding patterns"

# Development Environment
"Launch VS Code with my fitness-app project context"
"Set up Copilot for this Next.js project"
```
