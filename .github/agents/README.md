# A2A Agent System Configuration

This directory contains configuration for the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) intelligent agent system that autonomously fixes issues in the FitPathway Organizer project.

## Agent Types

### 1. Build Agent
- **Purpose**: Monitors and fixes build errors
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Detect TypeScript compilation errors
  - Fix missing dependencies
  - Resolve module resolution issues
  - Update build configuration

### 2. Test Agent
- **Purpose**: Ensures all tests pass
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Fix broken test configurations
  - Update test dependencies
  - Create missing test files
  - Fix failing test cases

### 3. Lint Agent
- **Purpose**: Maintains code quality standards
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Fix ESLint errors
  - Apply code style fixes
  - Remove unused code
  - Fix TypeScript type errors

### 4. Security Agent
- **Purpose**: Identifies and fixes security vulnerabilities
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Run CodeQL scans
  - Fix npm audit issues
  - Update vulnerable dependencies
  - Apply security patches

### 5. Integration Agent
- **Purpose**: Manages third-party integrations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Fix Lovable.dev sync issues
  - Manage GitHub workflows
  - Configure deployment pipelines
  - Handle OAuth and API integrations

## Agent Communication Protocol

Agents communicate through:
1. **GitHub Issues**: Report findings and proposed fixes
2. **Pull Requests**: Submit automated fixes
3. **Workflow Artifacts**: Share diagnostic data
4. **Comments**: Coordinate between agents

## Workflow Integration

The agent system integrates with GitHub Actions workflows:
- Triggered on push, PR, or schedule
- Each agent runs in parallel when possible
- Agents can trigger dependent workflows
- Results are aggregated and reported

## Configuration Files

- `build-agent.yml`: Build and TypeScript configuration
- `test-agent.yml`: Test suite configuration
- `lint-agent.yml`: Linting rules and auto-fix settings
- `security-agent.yml`: Security scanning configuration
- `integration-agent.yml`: Third-party service integration

## Autonomous Operation

The system operates autonomously by:
1. Monitoring repository health through workflows
2. Detecting issues via CI/CD pipeline failures
3. Analyzing root causes using diagnostic tools
4. Generating and testing fixes
5. Creating PRs with proposed solutions
6. Requesting human review only when necessary

## Usage

The agent system activates automatically when:
- Code is pushed to any branch
- Pull requests are created
- Scheduled maintenance runs (weekly)
- Manual workflow dispatch is triggered

No manual intervention required for routine fixes.
