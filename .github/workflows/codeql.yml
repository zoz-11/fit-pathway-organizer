# CodeQL Advanced Setup Workflow
# 
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is an ADVANCED CodeQL configuration.
# Before this workflow can run successfully, you MUST switch from Default to Advanced setup:
#   1. Go to: Settings → Security → Code Security
#   2. Find "Code scanning" section
#   3. Click "Switch to advanced" button
#   4. Confirm the switch
#
# This workflow will fail with SARIF upload errors if Default setup is still enabled.
# GitHub blocks SARIF uploads from advanced workflows when Default setup is active.
#
# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository.
#
# You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# or to provide custom queries or build logic.
#
# ******** NOTE ********
# We have attempted to detect the languages in your repository. Please check
# the `language` matrix defined below to confirm you have the correct set of
# supported CodeQL languages.
