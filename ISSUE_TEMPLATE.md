### Phase 1: Security Vulnerabilities (28 issues)
- **8 Critical**: XSS vulnerabilities, eval() usage, hardcoded credentials, SQL injection
- **15 High**: Input validation, authentication bypass, insecure configurations
- **5 Medium**: Missing logging, insufficient sanitization, weak session management

### Phase 2: Performance Issues (32 issues)  
- **12 High**: React performance problems, memory leaks, unoptimized rendering
- **18 Medium**: Inefficient state management, missing optimizations, unoptimized assets
- **2 Low**: Minor CSS and tooling improvements

### Phase 3: Accessibility Problems (24 issues)
- **16 Medium**: Missing alt text, poor contrast, keyboard navigation issues
- **8 Low**: Minor accessibility improvements, documentation gaps

### Phase 4: Code Quality Issues (26 issues)
- **10 High**: Bare except clauses, missing types, poor organization
- **12 Medium**: Naming inconsistencies, missing comments, code duplication
- **4 Low**: Style inconsistencies, TODO cleanup

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (14 issues)
- **6 Medium**: Low coverage, missing integration tests, no accessibility testing
- **8 Low**: Incomplete documentation, poor test organization

## 📋 Proposed Solution

### Security Hardening
- Replace `innerHTML` with `textContent` to eliminate XSS
- Remove `eval()` usage, implement `JSON.parse()` instead
- Move hardcoded credentials to environment variables
- Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure

### Performance Optimization
- Add useEffect dependency arrays to prevent infinite re-renders
- Implement useMemo for expensive calculations
- Add error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Optimize images with lazy loading and WebP format
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy()
- Add request caching and debouncing

### Accessibility Compliance
- Add alt text to all images
- Implement proper color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Add keyboard navigation support
- Implement ARIA labels and roles
- Add skip navigation links
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy

### Code Quality Modernization
- Replace bare except clauses with specific exception handling
- Add TypeScript annotations for type safety
- Implement consistent naming conventions
- Remove code duplication
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Standardize error handling patterns

### Testing Framework
- Achieve 80% minimum test coverage
- Implement integration testing with Jest + Supertest
- Add accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Set up performance testing with Lighthouse CI
- Implement security testing with OWASP ZAP
