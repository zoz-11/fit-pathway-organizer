# Quick Fix: Switching Default Branch from zoz-11-patch-15 to main

## Problem
You're getting an error when trying to switch the main branch to `zoz-11-patch-15` on Lovable.dev.

## Root Cause
- Your repository's default branch is currently set to `zoz-11-patch-15`
- However, all your recent work (186 commits) is on the `main` branch
- `zoz-11-patch-15` is 186 commits behind `main`
- When Lovable.dev tries to switch to this outdated branch, it fails

## Solution: Change Default Branch to `main`

### Step 1: Update Default Branch on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/zoz-11/fit-pathway-organizer/settings
2. Click **"Branches"** in the left sidebar
3. Under "Default branch" section, click the ⇄ (switch) button next to `zoz-11-patch-15`
4. Select **`main`** from the dropdown menu
5. Click **"Update"**
6. Confirm the change by clicking **"I understand, update the default branch"**

### Step 2: Update Lovable.dev Configuration

After changing the default branch on GitHub:

1. Go to your Lovable project: https://lovable.dev/projects/5ed9908e-fa3d-4618-b22f-017633a2f3af
2. The project should now automatically recognize `main` as the default branch
3. If needed, refresh the page or reconnect the repository

### Step 3: Verify the Change

```bash
# Clone the repository to verify
git clone https://github.com/zoz-11/fit-pathway-organizer.git
cd fit-pathway-organizer

# Check that you're on main
git branch
# Should show: * main

# Verify you have the latest code
git log --oneline -5
# Should show recent commits, not just the initial setup
```

## Why This Works

- **Main has all your work**: 186 commits with all recent development
- **zoz-11-patch-15 is outdated**: Only has 1 commit (initial setup)
- **Industry standard**: Using `main` as the default branch is the standard practice
- **Prevents confusion**: All tools (GitHub, Lovable.dev, CI/CD) will use `main` by default

## After the Fix

Once the default branch is changed to `main`:
- ✅ New pull requests will target `main` automatically
- ✅ Lovable.dev will work with the correct branch
- ✅ New clones will checkout `main` by default
- ✅ CI/CD workflows will run on `main`

## Do I Need to Merge Anything?

**No!** You don't need to merge `zoz-11-patch-15` into `main`. Here's why:
- `main` already has all the development work
- `zoz-11-patch-15` only has the initial setup commit
- All development has been happening on `main`

## Need More Details?

See [BRANCH_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md](./BRANCH_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md) for a comprehensive explanation and additional options.

**TL;DR**: Change your default branch from `zoz-11-patch-15` to `main` on GitHub Settings → Branches. Your work is on `main`, not on `zoz-11-patch-15`.
