2. Verify innerHTML replacements work correctly
3. Test eval() replacements with various inputs
4. Check that credentials are not exposed in code
5. Test exception handling with invalid inputs
6. Verify data validation on all forms
7. Run automated security scanner (OWASP ZAP)
8. Test with SQL injection payloads
9. Verify secure headers are in place
10. Check for sensitive data in logs
